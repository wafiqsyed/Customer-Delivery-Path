Program Design and Implementation 
=================================
  All methods and instance variables in ArrayStack.java are 
  implemented as required:                                     3.5  /3.5 marks

  All methods and instance variables in ComputePath.java are 
  implemented as required:                                     3.5  /4 marks
  
  TA comments: in the main method, should use args[0] instead of args[8]. Otherwise, the the program doesn't work in linux command. 

Programming Style
=================
  i) Meaningful names for variables and constants,
     all instance variables are private,
     only public methods are as specified in assignment:      1.5  /1.5 marks
	 
	 TA comments:

 ii) Readability, good indentation:                          0.5   /0.5 marks
 
     TA comments:

iii) Code comments 
     Instance variables and methods     
     Comments within code to explain algorithms implemented:  1.5  /1.5 marks

Testing
=======
  i) MyStack tests:          3  /3 marks
     Failed tests:

 ii) ComputePath tests:      6  /6 marks
     Failed tests: all tests 

iii) Bonus tests:             0 /1 mark

Late penalty:
Mark (total - late penalty): 19.5
